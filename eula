End User License Agreement
  
  1. INTRODUCTION
  1.1 This End User Licence Agreement (or "EULA") is a contract between you and
  LyriTunes. This EULA applies to the App "LyriTunes", the software in it including any
  patches or updates, any (future) in-app purchase content and any User Generated Content
  (which we explain in section 6) (we'll refer to them together as the "App").
  1.2 If you are under 18 years of age, please ask your parent or guardian to review and
  approve this EULA on your behalf (because in some countries people under the age of 18
  cannot enforceably enter into contracts like this EULA on their own).
  1.3 You confirm your agreement to this EULA by accepting it as part of the installation
  process of the App or using the App. If you do not agree this EULA, please do not install the
  App.
  1.4 If you think that this EULA is not complete in any respect, please contact us as soon as
  possible. If you do not do so within a reasonable period after you have installed the App or
  started to use the App, then you shall be considered to have agreed to the terms of this
  EULA.

  3. USING THE App
  3.1 In return for your acceptance of the terms of this EULA, we give you the personal right
  (known as a 'licence') to download and use the App on (i) any mobile or tablet device that you
  own or control and as permitted by the Usage Rules set forth in the Apple App Store &
  Google Play terms & conditions.
  3.2 This licence is for your personal use only (i.e. not for other people and not for commercial
  gain). We can terminate this licence in certain circumstances, which are explained further
  below. This licence is 'non-exclusive', meaning that we can grant similar licences to other
  people as well. It is also 'non-transferable', meaning it cannot be given to anyone else.
  4. PATCHES, UPDATES AND CHANGES
  4.1 From time to time, we may need to deploy or provide patches, updates, additional
  content or other modifications to the App (for example to enhance user experience, to add
  new features or to resolve software bugs). From time to time, we may also at our discretion
  remove or suspend access to particular features, content or other parts of the App.
  5. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
  5.1 The App, including the graphics, user interface and other content, contains proprietary
  information and material that is protected by copyright and other laws including but not
  limited to intellectual property. You agree that we own or license all of this proprietary
  information and material and that you may not use or exploit any of it without our
  permission. This does not cover the User Generated Content, which is addressed below.
  6. USER GENERATED CONTENT
  6.1 Any User Generated Content (UGC) you create is your property and you represent and
  warrant that:
  (a) it is your own work (i.e. you have not copied it);
  (b) you have not made the UGC to be deliberately offensive, including (but not limited to)
  indecent / pornographic content, etc., and the UGC is not defamatory and does not infringe
  any applicable laws;
  (c) the content may be shared, so you grant LyriTunes an irrevocable, worldwide,
  non-exclusive, royalty-free licence to use, reproduce, distribute, modify, adapt, publish,
  translate, prepare derivative works of and display the UGC and you waive any and all moral
  or similar rights you may have over the UGC;
  (d) you will indemnify and hold harmless LyriTunes for all damages, costs and expenses
  incurred for breaching theses warranties.
